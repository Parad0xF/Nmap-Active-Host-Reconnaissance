## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the Nmap Installer

   - Replace `URL_TO_NMAP_INSTALLER` with the download URL from the [official Nmap website](https://nmap.org/download.html).

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri URL_TO_NMAP_INSTALLER -OutFile "nmap-setup.exe"
    ```

    For example:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.91-setup.exe" -OutFile "nmap-setup.exe"
    ```

### Step 2: Run the Installer

#### Complete the Setup:

### Step 4: Verify Installation

- Confirm Nmap installation by opening a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window and running:
  ```powershell
  nmap -v
This should display the Nmap version, indicating successful installation.
## Running the PowerShell Script

To run the PowerShell script, follow these steps:

### Open PowerShell:
